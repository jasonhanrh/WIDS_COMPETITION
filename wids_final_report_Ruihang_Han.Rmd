# 1. Introduction

*To be completed: Introduce the WiDS Datathon++ 2025 challenge, describe the problem of predicting brain age using fMRI-derived connectome features and metadata. State the goal of evaluating model performance and examining sex-related differences in prediction and brain connectivity.*

# 2. Data and Preprocessing

*To be completed: Describe the dataset structure, variable types (connectome features, metadata), missing value handling, PCA for feature reduction, and creation of training and validation sets.*

The dataset comprises 1,104 adolescent participants aged 5 to 21 years, each represented by two main data sources: a 200×200 functional connectome matrix (upper triangular vectorized into \~20,000 features per individual) and rich metadata including demographic, psychological, and physiological attributes. The dataset was ingested from a CSV file and loaded into a `train_df` dataframe.

To understand the structural composition, we examined the dimensionality and variable types:

```{r}
dim(train_df)
colnames(train_df)[1:20]
tail(colnames(train_df), 20)
head(train_df[, 1:10])
table(sapply(train_df, class))
```

The dataframe contains 1,104 observations and nearly 20,000 columns, dominated by vectorized brain connectivity features (V\*) and supplemented by metadata fields. Data types span numeric and categorical variables, requiring both standard preprocessing and encoding for modeling purposes.

We assessed the extent of missing values across the dataset to guide appropriate imputation strategies:

```{r}
total_missing <- sum(is.na(train_df))
missing_ratio <- total_missing / (nrow(train_df) * ncol(train_df))
cat("Total missing values:", total_missing, "\n")
cat("Missing ratio:", round(missing_ratio * 100, 2), "%\n")

missing_cols <- colSums(is.na(train_df))
missing_cols[missing_cols > 0] %>% sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>% head(10)
```

Although the dataset includes 500 missing entries, this represents less than 0.01% of the data. Most missingness is concentrated in demographic variables such as parent_1_education (183 missing), race (168), and ethnicity (109). Given the sparse and localized nature of these missing values, we adopted tailored strategies such as median imputation for numeric fields and introducing “Missing” as a valid level for categorical variables during metadata preprocessing.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*To be completed: Provide summary statistics, variable distributions, and visualizations (e.g., PCA scatterplots, correlation heatmaps) to reveal patterns in metadata and connectome data.*

## 3.1 Demographic Variable Distributions

We began by examining categorical metadata to understand the demographic makeup of the dataset. Frequency counts and bar plots reveal the distribution across variables such as sex, race, handedness, study site, and parental education.

```{r}
# Frequency counts
list(
  sex = table(train_df$sex),
  race = table(train_df$race),
  handedness = table(train_df$handedness),
  study_site = table(train_df$study_site),
  ethnicity = table(train_df$ethnicity),
  parent_1_education = table(train_df$parent_1_education),
  parent_2_education = table(train_df$parent_2_education)
)
```

```{r}
# Visual summaries
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = sex)) + geom_bar(fill = "#66c2a5") + labs(title = "Sex Distribution") + theme_minimal()
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = race)) + geom_bar(fill = "#fc8d62") + labs(title = "Race Distribution") + theme_minimal()
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = handedness)) + geom_bar(fill = "#8da0cb") + labs(title = "Handedness Distribution") + theme_minimal()
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = study_site)) + geom_bar(fill = "#e78ac3") + labs(title = "Study Site Distribution") + theme_minimal()
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = parent_1_education)) + geom_bar(fill = "darkgreen") + labs(title = "Parent 1 Education", x = "Education Level") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) + theme_minimal()
```

The dataset reveals a moderate gender imbalance (688 males vs. 416 females), and a predominantly right-handed population. White is the most common race, followed by Other, Black, and Asian groups. Most participants were recruited from HBNsiteRU and HBNsiteCBIC, while parental education levels skew toward tertiary completion.

We examined potential interactions between sex and race using a mosaic plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = train_df) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(weight = 1, x = product(sex), fill = race)) +
  labs(title = "Mosaic Plot: Sex vs Race", x = "Sex", fill = "Race") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Race distribution is largely consistent across sex categories. White participants are the majority in both groups, followed by Other and Black. This consistency suggests minimal interaction between race and sex in this sample.

## 3.2 Summary Statistics of Continuous Variables

We summarized key continuous variables—age, BMI, and standardized psychological factors—using descriptive statistics.

```{r}
numeric_summary <- train_df %>%
  select(age, bmi, p_factor_fs, internalizing_fs, externalizing_fs, attention_fs) %>%
  summary()
numeric_summary
```

Participants range in age from approximately 5 to 22 years (mean ≈ 11.2), with BMI spanning from 12.6 to 46.1. Mental health scores are z-scored and exhibit moderate variability. The distributions provide a foundation for modeling age while accounting for psychological and developmental diversity.

## 3.3 Age and BMI Trends

To further explore distributional trends and group differences, we visualized age, BMI, and their interactions across demographic groups.

```{r}
# Age by sex
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = age, fill = as.factor(sex))) +
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Sex", x = "Age", fill = "Sex") +
  theme_minimal()

# BMI vs Age
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = age, y = bmi, color = as.factor(sex))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "BMI vs Age by Sex", x = "Age", y = "BMI", color = "Sex") +
  theme_minimal()

# BMI by Race
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = race, y = bmi, fill = race)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "BMI Distribution by Race") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

Age shows a right-skewed distribution, concentrated in early adolescence. BMI increases slightly with age, and distributions vary across races, with Asian participants showing the lowest median BMI and Black participants displaying wider dispersion.

## 3.4 Psychological Factors and Group Differences

We examined the structure and sex-based distribution of psychological scores, including the general psychopathology factor (`p_factor_fs`) and three specific domains: internalizing, externalizing, and attention.

```{r}
# Correlation matrix of mental health scores
train_df %>% 
  select(p_factor_fs, internalizing_fs, externalizing_fs, attention_fs) %>%
  ggpairs(title = "Correlation between Mental Health Factors")

```

The correlation matrix reveals that p-factor is moderately correlated with internalizing (r ≈ 0.20) and externalizing (r ≈ 0.27), while attention shows weak or inverse correlations, indicating relative independence from mood and behavior symptoms.

```{r}
# Mean psychological scores by sex
train_df %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(across(c(p_factor_fs, internalizing_fs, externalizing_fs, attention_fs), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-sex, names_to = "Factor", values_to = "Mean_Score") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Factor, y = Mean_Score, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Mental Health Scores by Sex") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Females report higher internalizing and p-factor scores, while males display more externalizing and attention-related symptoms. These patterns align with developmental trends observed in clinical literature.

```{r}
# Attention score by sex
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = sex, y = attention_fs, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Attention Score by Sex", x = "Sex", y = "Attention Factor Score") +
  theme_minimal()

# Optional: Age vs p-factor
ggplot(train_df, aes(x = age, y = p_factor_fs)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Age vs P-Factor", y = "P-Factor") +
  theme_minimal()
```

There is no substantial age-based trend in p-factor scores, suggesting general psychological distress levels remain relatively stable throughout the sampled age range.

## 3.5 Correlation Matrix of Continuous Predictors

We constructed a correlation heatmap across key continuous predictors to identify linear dependencies and potential multicollinearity:

```{r}
selected_vars <- train_df %>%
  select(age, bmi, p_factor_fs, internalizing_fs, externalizing_fs, attention_fs)

cor_matrix <- cor(selected_vars, use = "complete.obs")
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "lower", addCoef.col = "black", number.cex = 0.7,
         title = "Correlation Matrix of Selected Variables", mar = c(0, 0, 1, 0))
```

BMI and age exhibit a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.51). The mental health variables show relatively weak correlations, suggesting independent symptom dimensions and supporting their separate inclusion in modeling frameworks.

## 3.6 PCA of Brain Connectivity Features

We applied PCA to the high-dimensional connectome feature space to visualize dominant sources of variability.

```{r}
brain_data <- train_df %>% select(starts_with("V"))
pca_result <- prcomp(brain_data, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca_result$x[, 1:2])
pca_df$sex <- train_df$sex

ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "2D PCA Projection of Brain Functional Connectivity",
    x = "Principal Component 1",
    y = "Principal Component 2",
    color = "Sex"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The PCA projection reveals no major clustering or separation by sex, indicating that sex does not explain a large portion of variance in the first two components. Brain connectivity variation appears to be more individually driven or spread across higher-order dimensions.

# 4. Modeling and Prediction

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
set.seed(42)
```

## 4.1 Package Loading

We begin by loading the necessary R packages for data manipulation, modeling, cross-validation, and optimization.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(caret)
library(glmnet)
library(Metrics)
library(ggplot2)
library(xgboost)
library(broom)
library(doParallel)
library(ParBayesianOptimization)
```

## 4.2 Data Import and Splitting

The dataset was first loaded from a preprocessed `.rds` file. To evaluate model performance, we split the data into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets using stratified sampling based on the `sex` variable to preserve group proportions in both subsets.

```{r}
df <- readRDS("train_df.rds")
train_idx <- createDataPartition(df$sex, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train <- df[train_idx, ]
valid <- df[-train_idx, ]
```

## 4.3 PCA for Dimensionality Reduction (90% Variance)

To reduce dimensionality and mitigate noise in the connectome features, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the subset of variables starting with `V`, which represent the functional connectivity structure. Components were standardized before decomposition. We retained the minimum number of principal components required to explain at least 90% of the total variance, balancing representational fidelity and computational efficiency. The same transformation was applied to both training and validation sets using the loadings obtained from the training data.

```{r}
# Perform PCA on connectome features
pcs <- prcomp(select(train, starts_with("V")), center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# Extract proportion of variance explained by each principal component
explained_var <- summary(pcs)$importance[2, ]
cum_explained <- cumsum(explained_var)

# Determine number of components to retain 90% cumulative variance
n_pcs_90 <- which(cum_explained >= 0.90)[1]
cat("Number of principal components to retain:", n_pcs_90, "\n")

# Transform training and validation sets using the top components
train_pc <- as_tibble(pcs$x[, 1:n_pcs_90])
valid_pc <- predict(pcs, select(valid, starts_with("V")) %>%
                    scale(center = pcs$center, scale = pcs$scale))[, 1:n_pcs_90] %>%
                    as_tibble()

```

The PCA procedure indicated that 559 components were required to retain 90% of the total variance in the connectome features. This relatively large number reflects the high dimensionality and complexity of the original connectivity matrix. While PCA helped reduce noise and multicollinearity, the slow decay in variance suggests that information is broadly distributed across many dimensions, limiting the potential for aggressive dimensionality reduction.

## 4.4 Metadata Processing and Encoding

We extracted and preprocessed relevant metadata variables including demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, handedness), cognitive assessments (e.g., p-factor, internalizing, externalizing, attention), and study site information. Missing values in continuous variables such as BMI were imputed using the median. For categorical variables, missing levels were explicitly retained as a separate category labeled "Missing" to preserve potentially informative patterns. All categorical variables were then converted to dummy (one-hot) encoded format to ensure compatibility with downstream machine learning models.

```{r}
prepare_meta <- function(df) {
  df %>%
    select(participant_id, sex, bmi, p_factor_fs, internalizing_fs, externalizing_fs, attention_fs,
           race, study_site, handedness, parent_1_education) %>%
    mutate(
      bmi = ifelse(is.na(bmi), median(bmi, na.rm = TRUE), bmi),
      across(c(sex, race, study_site, handedness, parent_1_education), ~ fct_na_value_to_level(factor(.), "Missing"))
    )
}
encode <- function(data) model.matrix(~ . -1, data = data)

train_meta <- prepare_meta(train)
valid_meta <- prepare_meta(valid)

train_meta_enc <- bind_cols(as_tibble(encode(train_meta %>% select(-participant_id))), tibble(participant_id = train_meta$participant_id))
valid_meta_enc <- bind_cols(as_tibble(encode(valid_meta %>% select(-participant_id))), tibble(participant_id = valid_meta$participant_id))
```

## 4.5 Merging PCA Features and Metadata

To prepare the final modeling datasets, we combined the PCA-transformed connectome features with the encoded metadata using `participant_id` as the join key. This ensured that each observation retained both its neuroimaging and contextual information. We then defined the predictors (`X_train`, `X_valid`) and the response variable (`y_train`, `y_valid`) by aligning with participants present in the merged datasets, removing identifier fields to ensure compatibility with downstream algorithms.

```{r}
train_pc_df <- train_pc %>% mutate(participant_id = train$participant_id)
valid_pc_df <- valid_pc %>% mutate(participant_id = valid$participant_id)

train_merged <- inner_join(train_pc_df, train_meta_enc, by = "participant_id")
valid_merged <- inner_join(valid_pc_df, valid_meta_enc, by = "participant_id")

X_train <- train_merged %>% select(-participant_id)
y_train <- train %>% filter(participant_id %in% train_merged$participant_id) %>% pull(age)
X_valid <- valid_merged %>% select(-participant_id)
y_valid <- valid %>% filter(participant_id %in% valid_merged$participant_id) %>% pull(age)
```

## 4.6 Lasso Feature Selection (Metadata Only)

To identify the most informative predictors among the metadata variables, we applied Lasso regression with 10-fold cross-validation. Lasso imposes an L1 penalty, shrinking less important coefficients toward zero and effectively performing variable selection. This approach helps reduce overfitting and improves model interpretability by eliminating redundant or weakly associated features. The selected variables were retained for use in subsequent modeling steps involving metadata-PCA integration.

```{r}
# Extract metadata features (excluding participant ID)
X_train_meta <- train_meta_enc %>% select(-participant_id)
X_meta_mat <- as.matrix(X_train_meta)

# Perform Lasso regression with 10-fold cross-validation
cv_lasso <- cv.glmnet(
  X_meta_mat, y_train,
  alpha = 1,                          # Lasso penalty
  nfolds = 10,                        # 10-fold CV
  standardize = TRUE,                # Standardize predictors
  type.measure = "mse"               # Use MSE to evaluate
)

# Extract coefficients at optimal lambda
lasso_coefs <- coef(cv_lasso, s = "lambda.min")

# Select non-zero coefficient features (excluding intercept)
lasso_selected <- rownames(lasso_coefs)[
  lasso_coefs[, 1] != 0 & rownames(lasso_coefs) != "(Intercept)"
]

# Display selected metadata features
cat("Selected metadata features:\n")
print(lasso_selected)

```

Lasso regression identified six metadata variables with non-zero coefficients at the optimal penalty level. These included `bmi`, `externalizing_fs`, `attention_fs`, one study site indicator (`HBNsiteRU`), and two levels of parental education. The selected features represent a combination of individual clinical assessments and sociodemographic context, suggesting that both biological and environmental factors contribute to brain age prediction. These variables were retained in subsequent models to improve parsimony and interpretability.

## 4.7 Ridge Regression

### 4.7.1 Full PCA + Metadata

We fitted a Ridge regression model to the combined feature set, which included both the PCA-transformed connectome features and the full set of encoded metadata variables. Ridge regression was chosen for its ability to handle multicollinearity and retain all input variables by applying L2 regularization. To ensure consistent fold assignments across experiments, we used fixed fold IDs for 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE on the validation set.

```{r}
# Convert training and validation predictors to matrix format
X_train_mat <- as.matrix(X_train)
X_valid_mat <- as.matrix(X_valid)

# Manually define fold IDs for reproducibility in cross-validation
set.seed(42)
foldid <- sample(rep(1:10, length.out = length(y_train)))  # 10-fold CV assignment

# Fit Ridge regression model using cross-validation with fixed folds
cv_ridge <- cv.glmnet(
  X_train_mat, y_train,
  alpha = 0,                     # alpha = 0 for Ridge
  nfolds = 10,                   # number of folds
  foldid = foldid,               # use predefined fold IDs
  standardize = TRUE,           # standardize predictors
  type.measure = "mse"          # use mean squared error as metric
)

# Make predictions on the validation set using optimal lambda
ridge_pred <- predict(cv_ridge, newx = X_valid_mat, s = "lambda.min") %>% as.vector()

# Calculate RMSE for Ridge predictions
ridge_rmse <- rmse(y_valid, ridge_pred)
cat("Ridge regression validation RMSE:", round(ridge_rmse, 4), "\n")

# Visualize predicted vs actual values
ridge_plot <- ggplot(data.frame(Predicted = ridge_pred, Actual = y_valid), aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Ridge Regression: Predicted vs Actual Age") +
  theme_minimal()
print(ridge_plot)


```

The Ridge regression model achieved a validation RMSE of **6.80**, indicating moderate predictive accuracy. As shown in the scatter plot, the predicted ages are positively correlated with the actual ages, but there is a noticeable tendency to underestimate older participants and overestimate younger ones. This pattern suggests that the model captures general trends but may be limited in modeling extreme values. The fitted regression line (in blue) deviates from the ideal diagonal, indicating room for improvement in calibration.

This bias may reflect limitations in the linear model's ability to capture complex, nonlinear relationships in the feature space.

### 4.7.2 PCA + Lasso-Selected Metadata

To improve model parsimony and potentially enhance generalization, we re-estimated the Ridge regression using only the metadata features selected by the Lasso procedure. These reduced metadata variables were combined with the same PCA-derived connectome components used previously. This selective feature approach aimed to reduce noise and emphasize variables with stronger predictive signals.

```{r}
# Select metadata features identified by Lasso
X_train_lasso_meta <- X_train_meta[, lasso_selected]
X_valid_lasso_meta <- X_valid %>% select(all_of(colnames(X_train_lasso_meta)))

# Combine selected metadata with top principal components
X_train_lasso_pca <- cbind(train_pc, X_train_lasso_meta)
X_valid_lasso_pca <- cbind(valid_pc, X_valid_lasso_meta)

# Convert combined features to matrix format
X_train_lasso_pca_mat <- as.matrix(X_train_lasso_pca)
X_valid_lasso_pca_mat <- as.matrix(X_valid_lasso_pca)

# Fit Ridge regression using cross-validation
cv_ridge_lasso_pca <- cv.glmnet(
  X_train_lasso_pca_mat, y_train,
  alpha = 0,                          # alpha = 0 for Ridge
  nfolds = 10,                        # 10-fold CV
  standardize = TRUE,
  type.measure = "mse"
)

# Predict on validation set using the model with optimal lambda
ridge_lasso_pca_pred <- predict(cv_ridge_lasso_pca, newx = X_valid_lasso_pca_mat, s = "lambda.min") %>% as.vector()

# Calculate RMSE
ridge_lasso_pca_rmse <- rmse(y_valid, ridge_lasso_pca_pred)
cat("Ridge (Lasso Metadata + PCA) validation RMSE:", round(ridge_lasso_pca_rmse, 4), "\n")

```

The Ridge model using only Lasso-selected metadata in combination with PCA-transformed features achieved a validation RMSE of **6.81**, which is nearly identical to the full-feature Ridge model. This suggests that the excluded metadata variables had minimal predictive value, and the reduced model retained most of the relevant signal. From a modeling perspective, this more parsimonious specification is preferable, as it simplifies interpretation and may generalize better to unseen data.

### 4.7.3 Ridge with 5-Fold Averaging

To further stabilize the Ridge model predictions and reduce variance, we implemented a 5-fold ensemble strategy. In each iteration, the model was trained on 80% of the training data and evaluated on the full validation set. Final predictions were obtained by averaging results across all five models. This ensemble approach helps mitigate sensitivity to data splits and improves generalization.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(glmnet)
library(caret)
library(Metrics)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Create 5-fold cross-validation splits
folds <- createFolds(y_train, k = 5)

# Initialize list to store predictions for each fold
ridge_preds <- list()

# Train Ridge model on each fold and predict on the full validation set
for (i in seq_along(folds)) {
  fold_valid_idx <- folds[[i]]
  
  # Use remaining folds for training
  X_tr <- X_train_lasso_pca[-fold_valid_idx, ]
  y_tr <- y_train[-fold_valid_idx]
  
  # Fit Ridge model on current training fold
  ridge_model <- cv.glmnet(as.matrix(X_tr), y_tr, alpha = 0, nfolds = 5)
  
  # Predict on full validation set
  ridge_pred <- predict(ridge_model, newx = as.matrix(X_valid_lasso_pca), s = "lambda.min") %>% as.vector()
  
  # Store prediction
  ridge_preds[[i]] <- ridge_pred
}

# Combine predictions from all folds and compute mean prediction
ridge_matrix <- do.call(cbind, ridge_preds)
ridge_lasso_pca_pred <- rowMeans(ridge_matrix)

# Compute standard deviation across folds (for potential residual uncertainty analysis)
ridge_lasso_pca_sd <- apply(ridge_matrix, 1, sd)

# Compute RMSE on validation set
ridge_lasso_pca_rmse <- rmse(y_valid, ridge_lasso_pca_pred)
cat("Ridge (5-Fold Averaging) validation RMSE:", round(ridge_lasso_pca_rmse, 4), "\n")

# Visualize predicted vs actual age
ggplot(data.frame(Predicted = ridge_lasso_pca_pred, Actual = y_valid), aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Ridge (5-Fold Ensemble): Predicted vs Actual Age") +
  theme_minimal()


```

The 5-fold averaged Ridge model achieved a validation RMSE of **5.94**, demonstrating a substantial improvement over both the full Ridge model (RMSE = 6.80) and the reduced Ridge model using Lasso-selected features (RMSE = 6.81). By averaging predictions across multiple fold-specific models, this ensemble approach helped reduce variance and stabilize predictions.

The predicted-versus-actual scatter plot shows improved alignment with the ideal diagonal line, particularly for mid-range age values. The slope of the fitted trend line is steeper than in previous Ridge models, indicating better calibration across the range of predicted ages. These results highlight the benefit of fold-wise ensembling for increasing robustness and generalization in linear models.

## 4.8 XGBoost with Bayesian Optimization

To capture nonlinear relationships and improve predictive accuracy, we implemented an XGBoost regression model with hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian Optimization. XGBoost is a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm known for its performance and flexibility. Rather than using grid or random search, we adopted Bayesian Optimization to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space, focusing on the learning rate (`eta`) and tree depth (`max_depth`). Model performance was monitored using RMSE on the validation set.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(xgboost)
library(ParBayesianOptimization)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Prepare training and validation sets in DMatrix format
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(X_train), label = y_train)
dvalid <- xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(X_valid), label = y_valid)

# Define the objective function for Bayesian optimization
bayes_xgb_function <- function(eta, max_depth) {
  set.seed(42)  # Ensure reproducible results in each iteration
  params <- list(
    booster = "gbtree",
    objective = "reg:squarederror",
    eval_metric = "rmse",
    tree_method = "hist",
    eta = eta,
    max_depth = as.integer(max_depth),
    subsample = 0.8,
    colsample_bytree = 0.8
  )
  
  # Train model and return negative RMSE for maximization

The XGBoost model was tuned via Bayesian Optimization over 10 iterations, targeting optimal values for `eta` and `max_depth`. The training process successfully converged after 159 boosting rounds, yielding a minimum validation RMSE of **2.6868**, the lowest among all individual models evaluated.

The scatter plot of predicted versus actual age shows a tighter concentration of points along the diagonal reference line compared to Ridge regression models, suggesting improved prediction accuracy and calibration. However, the model still slightly underestimates age for older participants, as indicated by systematic deviations from the diagonal in the upper-right quadrant.

Overall, XGBoost outperformed linear models in terms of RMSE, likely due to its ability to capture complex nonlinear interactions among metadata and PCA features. These findings support the inclusion of gradient-boosted trees as a strong standalone predictor or a base learner in ensemble frameworks.

## 4.9 Model Ensembling: Ridge + XGBoost

To leverage the complementary strengths of linear and nonlinear models, we constructed a simple ensemble that linearly combines predictions from the Ridge and XGBoost models. Ridge captures additive linear effects efficiently, while XGBoost is capable of modeling complex, nonlinear interactions. We evaluated a series of ensemble weights, ranging from 0 to 0.95 for the Ridge component, and selected the weight that minimized RMSE on the validation set.

```{r}
# Define a sequence of weights for Ridge predictions (from 0 to 0.95)
weights <- seq(0, 0.95, by = 0.05)

# Compute RMSE for each ensemble weight (Ridge weight w, XGBoost weight 1 - w)
ensemble_rmse <- sapply(weights, function(w) {
  rmse(y_valid, w * ridge_lasso_pca_pred + (1 - w) * xgb_pred)
})

# Identify the best weight that minimizes RMSE
best_w <- weights[which.min(ensemble_rmse)]
cat("Optimal ensemble weight (Ridge):", best_w, 
    " | Corresponding RMSE:", round(min(ensemble_rmse), 4), "\n")

# Plot validation RMSE vs ensemble weight
ensemble_plot <- ggplot(data.frame(Weight = weights, RMSE = ensemble_rmse), aes(x = Weight, y = RMSE)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = best_w, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Ensemble Weight vs Validation RMSE", 
       x = "Ridge Weight", y = "Validation RMSE") +
  theme_minimal()

print(ensemble_plot)

```

To further improve predictive performance, we constructed a simple weighted ensemble by linearly combining predictions from the Ridge and XGBoost models. Specifically, we evaluated a range of weights $w \in [0, 0.95]$ applied to the Ridge model output, with $1 - w$ assigned to XGBoost.

As shown in Figure X, the ensemble RMSE exhibits a clear U-shaped trend, reaching a minimum of **2.2437** when the Ridge model was assigned a weight of **0.2**. This indicates that the XGBoost model, while more dominant, benefits from a small contribution of Ridge predictions, likely due to their ability to capture linear signals that may not be prioritized by tree-based learners.

This result demonstrates that ensemble averaging can yield performance gains over individual models by leveraging complementary model strengths. The ensemble RMSE of 2.2437 represents the best performance achieved across all modeling strategies evaluated.

## 4.10 Residual Distribution Plots

To assess model calibration and detect potential systematic biases, we examined the distribution of residuals from the Ridge, XGBoost, and ensemble models. Residuals were defined as the difference between actual and predicted values. A well-calibrated model should exhibit residuals approximately centered around zero and symmetrically distributed, with limited skewness or extreme outliers.

```{r}
# Residual plot for Ridge model
resid_ridge <- y_valid - ridge_lasso_pca_pred

ggplot(data.frame(Residual = resid_ridge), aes(x = Residual)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Ridge Model Residual Distribution",
    x = "Residual (Actual - Predicted)",
    y = "Count"
  )

# Residual plot for XGBoost model
resid_xgb <- y_valid - xgb_pred

ggplot(data.frame(Residual = resid_xgb), aes(x = Residual)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "darkorange", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "XGBoost Model Residual Distribution",
    x = "Residual (Actual - Predicted)",
    y = "Count"
  )

# Residual plot for Ensemble model
resid_ensemble <- y_valid - (best_w * ridge_lasso_pca_pred + (1 - best_w) * xgb_pred)

ggplot(data.frame(Residual = resid_ensemble), aes(x = Residual)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Ensemble Model Residual Distribution",
    x = "Residual (Actual - Predicted)",
    y = "Count"
  )

```

The residual distributions of the Ridge, XGBoost, and Ensemble models provide insights into the prediction error characteristics of each approach. The Ridge model exhibits a wide and relatively symmetric residual spread, but with heavier tails, indicating higher variance in its predictions. The XGBoost model, while achieving lower RMSE, shows a left-skewed residual distribution, suggesting a tendency to overestimate the target variable (age). Notably, the ensemble model combining Ridge and XGBoost achieves the most compact and symmetric residual distribution, reflecting reduced bias and variance. This improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of model ensembling in enhancing predictive stability and accuracy.

## 4.11 Stacking Ensemble & Residual Diagnostics

To further enhance predictive performance, we implemented a stacking ensemble approach. In this framework, predictions from the Ridge and XGBoost models were used as inputs to a second-level meta-learner, which was trained to optimize the final prediction. We selected XGBoost as the meta-learner due to its flexibility and ability to model nonlinear relationships between base model outputs. This method allows the ensemble to learn optimal weights or interactions beyond simple averaging.

```{r}
# Load required package
library(glmnet)

# Step 1: Construct second-level training data using predictions from base models
stack_train <- data.frame(
  Ridge = ridge_lasso_pca_pred,
  XGB = xgb_pred
)

# Convert stacking inputs into DMatrix format for XGBoost
dstack <- xgb.DMatrix(as.matrix(stack_train), label = y_valid)

# Step 2: Train meta-learner (XGBoost) on top of base model predictions
meta_xgb <- xgb.train(
  params = list(
    booster = "gbtree",
    objective = "reg:squarederror",
    eta = 0.05,
    max_depth = 2,
    subsample = 1,
    colsample_bytree = 1,
    eval_metric = "rmse"
  ),
  data = dstack,
  nrounds = 100,
  verbose = 0
)

# Step 3: Make predictions using the stacking ensemble
final_pred <- predict(meta_xgb, newdata = dstack)

# Step 4: Evaluate RMSE on the validation set
stacking_rmse <- rmse(y_valid, final_pred)
cat("Stacking Ensemble validation RMSE:", round(stacking_rmse, 4), "\n")

# Predicted vs Actual Plot
ggplot(data.frame(Predicted = final_pred, Actual = y_valid), aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "#377eb8") +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray40") +
  labs(
    title = "Stacking Ensemble: Predicted vs Actual Age",
    x = "Actual Age",
    y = "Predicted Age"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Residual Histogram
resid_stacking <- y_valid - final_pred

ggplot(data.frame(Residual = resid_stacking), aes(x = Residual)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#4daf4a", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Stacking Ensemble Residual Distribution",
    x = "Residual (Actual - Predicted)",
    y = "Count"
  )


```

The stacking ensemble, which combines Ridge and XGBoost predictions through a meta-learner trained on their outputs, achieves a validation RMSE of 1.7359, the lowest among all modeling strategies. This significant performance gain highlights the complementary nature of the base learners: Ridge contributes stability across broader patterns, while XGBoost captures complex nonlinearities. The result affirms that stacking effectively leverages model diversity to enhance generalization and reduce prediction error.

The predicted versus actual plot for the stacking ensemble demonstrates a strong alignment along the 45-degree reference line, indicating high predictive accuracy. Compared to base models, the stacking approach reduces dispersion and compresses extreme deviations, particularly for younger subjects. This suggests that the ensemble effectively integrates complementary strengths from Ridge and XGBoost models, yielding more robust estimates of age.

The residual distribution for the stacking model is centered near zero and exhibits a relatively symmetric bell shape with minimal skewness, reflecting well-calibrated predictions. The distribution is also narrower compared to that of individual models, indicating a reduction in both variance and extreme errors. This improvement in residual behavior further supports the superiority of the ensemble over single-model approaches.

The modeling section presented a comprehensive comparison of predictive approaches for estimating brain age from connectome and metadata features. Among all models, the stacked ensemble demonstrated the best performance, achieving a validation RMSE of 1.7359, substantially outperforming individual learners.

Specifically, the Ridge regression with full PCA and metadata produced an RMSE of 6.8021, which was slightly improved by restricting the metadata to Lasso-selected variables (6.8132) and further reduced to 5.9377 via a 5-fold ensembling strategy. These results suggest that dimensionality reduction and variable selection modestly enhance linear models, while ensemble averaging significantly mitigates variance and overfitting.

The XGBoost model, tuned through Bayesian optimization, yielded a much lower RMSE of 2.6868, highlighting the effectiveness of nonlinear tree-based methods in capturing complex interactions. The residuals from XGBoost were also more symmetrically distributed compared to Ridge, indicating better calibration and less systemic bias.

A simple weighted ensemble of Ridge and XGBoost models further reduced the RMSE to 2.2437, and the stacking ensemble—which used XGBoost as a meta-learner trained on base model predictions—achieved the best generalization. Its residual distribution was tightly centered around zero with lower dispersion, suggesting reduced bias and variance.

These findings underscore the benefits of model ensembling and stacking in high-dimensional neuroimaging data, particularly when combining complementary model architectures. They also validate the importance of incorporating both connectome-derived features and carefully selected metadata in predictive modeling pipelines.
